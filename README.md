Hi, I'm Dominik Bünger! 
- He / Him
- Spelling my name as either Bunger or Buenger is fine as well :)
- My birth name (pre-marriage) was Dominik Alfke
- I'm originally from Germany, but I currently live in Vancouver, Canada

I'm passionate about lots of things...
- Efficient Numerical Linear Algebra, particularly eigenvalue computation and its applications
- Machine Learning research, especially geometric learning on graphs
- Techniques for large-scale 3D point clouds, e.g., from LiDAR scans
- Elegant programming, most recently mainly in Python and C/C++/Cuda, but also in Java, Julia, Javascript, Matlab, SQL, C#
- All types of music that aren't German Schlager!
